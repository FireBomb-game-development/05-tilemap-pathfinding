# 05-tilemap-pathfinding

Welcome to the repository of our indie studio, FireBaseGameDevelopment! Here, we embark on our first mission to master 2D tilemap designing and specialize in auto-generating maps. We're also delving into graph algorithms for NPC movement and character pathfinding.

## Introduction

In this repository, we are focusing on honing our skills in 2D tilemap design and automating map generation. Additionally, we are exploring graph algorithms for NPC behavior and character pathfinding. This project is a testament to our dedication to mastering these aspects of game development.

## Files Overview

- `spawner.py`: This file contains the main function responsible for spawning a character in a randomized position.
- `states_engine.py`: Here, you can find the implementation of the states engine for NPCs. It introduces multiple states such as chaser, sleep, scout (rotate), and more.

## Features

- **Tilemap Designing**: We are mastering the art of 2D tilemap designing to create visually appealing game environments.
- **Auto-generating Maps**: Our focus includes automating the process of map generation to enhance efficiency and variety in game levels.
- **Graph Algorithms for NPC Movement**: Utilizing graph algorithms to develop intelligent NPC behaviors, allowing for dynamic and engaging interactions.
- **Character Pathfinding**: Implementing pathfinding algorithms to enable characters to navigate through the game world seamlessly.

## External Resources

- **Cycle State Machine**: For handling the cycle states of NPCs, we utilize the Cycle State Machine available on [itch.io](https://unitime.itch.io/cyclestatemachin).
- **Cave Generator**: To aid in map generation, we make use of the Cave Generator tool available on [itch.io](https://unitime.itch.io/cavegeneratorspwnercheck).

## How to Use

To make use of the functionalities provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the files mentioned above to understand the implementation details.
3. Modify and integrate the provided code into your game development projects as needed.
